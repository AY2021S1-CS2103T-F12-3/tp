## Project: Cap 5.0 Buddy

Cap 5.0 Buddy helps NUS SoC students to keep track of their module details and contacts efficiently. It helps them centralize key module details, contacts and information,  and follows their study progress through a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows efficient management of module details.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete modules.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove a module from the Module List.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as it allows the user to remove unnecessary modules from the Module List.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added the Assignment components to each module.
  * What it does: 
  * Justification:

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactored Add / Delete / View / Edit / Add Zoom Link commands (Pull requests [\#200](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/pull/200))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

* _{you can add/remove categories in the list above}_
