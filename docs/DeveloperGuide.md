## **Introduction**

CAP5Buddy helps NUS SoC students to keep track of their module details efficiently. It helps them centralize key
module details and follows their study progress through a Command Line Interface (CLI) that allows efficient management
of module details. CAP5Buddy also functions as a scheduling system, todo list and contact list.

## **1. Setting up**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Design**

### Architecture

**How the architecture components interact with each other**
![Structure of the Overall Product](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

### Overall components

This is the overall design of our product. As we are using **GUI to help to display the information** and mainly focuses on
using **CLI to take in the required commands**, thus the product consists of **6 main major components**. The product starts
from the Launcher classes, that initiates based on our pre-set settings and then activates the MainApp class
the will run the GUI with these settings. MainApp will also start the _brain_ and -muscles_ of the program, which are the Logic, Storage,
Model and Ui components.

The role of the **Logic** component is to act as the _brain_ of the program, where all the parsing of information will be done, and the
execution of the commands will be carried out.

The role of the **Storage** component is to represent the _memory_ of the program, where the storing and tracking of the different items happens.
These items are saving locally in a json file, which can be imported and exported easily.

The role of the **Model** component is to represent all the items and their behaviours. Contains all the item classes and their support classes.

The role of the **Ui** component is to handle all the User interface related instructions, which includes the loading of GUI components, the updating
of these components and displaying the changes.


### UI component
![Structure of the UserInterface Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The job of the UI component is to be the _face_ of the product, which the user directly interacts with.
It is in charge of containing the logic that **breaks down and executes the user input**, and displaying the **GUI** of the
product.

It composes of a few main classes, that serves as the focal point of this component. Such classes are **UiPart**,
**MainWindow**, **UiManager** and the respective panel displays, **(XYZListPanel)**. The rest of the classes are supporting
classes to help make the GUI.

The MainWindow is what the user actually sees, which has a **CommandBox**, **XYZListPanel**, **ResultDisplay** and **StatusBar**. These
components are stacking on top of one another using **stackPane** to ensure a smooth looking GUI. The order of the components
are as follows, **CommandBox**, **ResultDisplay**, **XYZListPanel** and **StatusBar**.

The **CommandBox** is just a textField component where the user can enter the commands. Upon pressing *Enter*, extracting of the
text occurs and is sent to the logic to be parsed and executed.

Next, after the executing is completed, a **CommandResult** object returns and is then passed to the **ResultDisplay** for the
relevant information to be shown in this component. This is being displayed in a TextArea component.

Lastly, the **XYZListPanel** is in charge of displaying all the modules, contacts, etc that is the product is tracking.
Each of these items are being displayed in a *cell* under their respective **XYZCard**, which will be displayed in the *ListCell*
of the **XYZListPanel**.


**API** :

### Logic component

![LogicClassDiagram](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** : `Logic.java`

1. `Logic` uses the `ParserManager` class to create the respective classes: `ModuleListParser`, `ContactListParser`, `TodoListParser`,
   `GradeTrackerParser` and `SchedulerParser` which will parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the Model (e.g. adding a module).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
5. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
help to the user.

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the data for these 3 types of list:
  * module tracker
  * contact list
  * todo list
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<T>` for all types of list as mentioned above which can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component facilitates the storage of CAP5BUDDY data in the hard drive. When the program attempts to save
data, the `Storage` component converts java data objects such as `ModuleList` and `ContactList` into a json format to store
at a specified file location. When the program is started, it will attempt to read existing user data and the `Storage`
component will be converting data in json format into java objects.

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the module list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the contact list data in json format and read it back.
* can save the todo list data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


## 3.1 Module list management feature




### Module list features




### Module Assignment 

### \[Proposed\] GradeTracker feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed grade tracker feature is an association class used to store additional information for the module. 
The `Assignments` each store their own `assignment name`, `percentage of final grade` and `result`. 


![Structure of the Module List Component](images/GradeTrackerDiagram.png)


When an `assignment` is added, it follows the sequence diagram as shown below. The sequence flows similarly 
to the rest of the project as the command is parsed and then executed.

![Sequence Diagram of the Add Assignment Command](images/AddAssignmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Format to store the grade for a module
* Alternative 1 : Grade stores CAP.
    * Pros : Easier to integrate with Cap Calculator
    * Cons : User has to manually input CAP and does not know the average from the assignments accumulated
    
* Alternative 2 (current choice): Grade stores the raw score calculated from assignment
    * Pros : Grade can be automatically calculated from the assignment overall percentage for user to view
    * Cons : Requires separate CAP to be stored for Cap Calculator to access



### Cap Calculator

### \[Proposed\] Calculate CAP feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed calculate CAP function is facilitated by `CalculateCapCommand`. It extends Command with a counter for total
grade points and modular credits, both stored internally `gradePoints` and `modularCredits` respectively. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CalculateCapCommand#accumulate(ModuleList)` - Loops through a given `ModuleList` and updates the grade points and
modular credits count accordingly.

* `CalculateCapCommand#calculateCap()` - Calculates CAP based the grade points and modular credits counter.

The following sequence diagram shows how the calculate cap operation works:
![CalculateCapSequenceDiagram](images/CalculateCapSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CalculateCapCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Information used to calculate cap
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Calculates based on academic information on mods tagged as completed.
    * Pros : Easy to implement
    * Cons : User has to manually input every module taken
    
* Alternative 2 : Prompts user for academic information used for last calculated cap and stores it.
    * Pros : 
     * User does not need to input unnecessary modules.
     * Will use less memory.(e.g Modules that the user is not currently taking does not need to be added by user). 
    * Cons : Will require additional storage.




## 3.1.4  Module zoom link management feature

As Cap 5 Buddy is designed to be a module tracking application for SoC students,
it is crucial to design features which allows efficient management of zoom links which are widely used by modules during
online learning. However, it is worth noting that these features can be easily modified to manage any website links,
showcasing the usefulness of these features for tracking module related details beyond online learning.

The section below provides details of the implementation of each zoom link related function and design considerations
of these features.

#### Details of implementation

##### 3.1.4.1  Add zoom link feature

This feature creates and adds a new `ZoomLink` for a `ModuleLesson` into a specific `Module`, if the 
zoom link does not already exist in the module. Each `ModuleLesson` in a `Module` is only allowed to have one `ZoomLink`.

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:
  * `AddZoomLinkParser`:
    * It implements `AddZoomLinkParser#parse()` to validate and the parse the module index and zoom link details, and creates
      a `ZoomDescriptor` object.
  * `ZoomDescriptor`:
    * It stores and encapsulates the `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` objects which will be added to the specified `Module`
  * `AddZoomLinkCommand`:
    * It implements `AddZoomLinkCommand#execute()` which executes the addition of the `ZoomLink` and its corresponding
      `ModuleLesson` into the `Module` encapsulated in `Model`
      
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding zoom links behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `addzoom 1 n/Lecture z/https://nus-sg.zoom.us/link` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ModuleListParser#parseCommand()` to create an `AddZoomLinkParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ModuleListParser` will call the `AddZoomLinkParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates an `AddZoomLinkCommand` using a `ZoomDescriptor` object that encapsulates the `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` to be added

Step 5. `AddZoomLinkCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to create
        the updated `Module` with the added `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` by calling the `Module#addZoomLink()` method

Step 5. The `Model#setModule()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to replace the target module with the updated module containing the newly added zoom link

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to add a zoom link works:
![AddZoomLinkSequenceDiagram](images/AddZoomLinkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
Fig 3.1.4 Sequence diagram for the execution of `AddZoomLinkCommand`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddZoomLinkCommand` and `AddZoomLinkParser` should end 
at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<br>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `AddZoomLinkCommand`:
![AddZoomLinkActivityDiagram](images/AddZoomLinkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to encapsulate zoom links and module lesson fields

* **Alternative 1:** Store zoom link and module lesson as strings 

  * Pros: Easier to implement as we do not need to create extra classes to encapsulate these objects.
  * Cons: Does not adhere to OOP principles as higher level classes such as `Parser` need to be aware of lower level details, such 
          as the regular expression of a zoom link.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create classes to represent `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` objects

  * Pros: Adheres strongly to OOP principles as we are able to abstract out the lower level details of `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` into their respective classes.
          We will be able to better demonstrate the behaviour of the respective `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` objects.
          It facilitates future development of the project if zoom link or module lesson were to have certain states or behaviour that have to be implemented. 
  * Cons: Additional classes have to be implemented to encapsulate zoom link and module lesson. These classes may appear to be
          unnecessary since zoom link and module lesson do not currently have significant states or behaviour.

Alternative 1 was chosen since it followed OOP principles which is a good practice in a SE project. Also, it provides
greater flexibility for expansion of the project.


##### 3.1.4.2  Delete zoom link feature

This feature deletes an existing zoom link from a module using the module lesson that is mapped to the
target zoom link.

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:
  
  * `DeleteZoomLinkParser`:
    * It implements `DeleteZoomLinkParser#parse()` to validate and parse the module index and module lesson provided by the user.
  * `DeleteZoomLinkCommand`:
    * It implements `DeleteZoomLinkCommand#execute()` to delete the zoom link from the module 
      using the unique module lesson that is mapped to the target zoom link.  
      
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for deleting zoom links behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `deletezoom 1 n/Lecture` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ModuleListParser#parseCommand()` to create a `DeleteZoomLinkParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ModuleListParser` will call the `DeleteZoomLinkParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates a `DeleteZoomLinkCommand` and `DeleteZoomLinkCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` 

Step 5. This deletes the target zoom link identified by its unique module lesson using the `Module#deleteZoomLink()` method

Step 6. The `Model#setModule()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to replace the target module with the updated module

Step 7. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`


##### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Limit on the number of zoom links that can be mapped to each module lesson

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Each module lesson can only be mapped to a single zoom link
  * Pros: The execution of a zoom link command is less complicated as each zoom link is uniquely identified by its module lesson. 
          The implementation of the command is easier as we only need to identify the correct module lesson and
          remove the key value pair from the hashmap.
  * Cons: Creates a restriction for users as they are only allowed to add one zoom link for each module lesson.

* **Alternative 2:** Each module lesson can be mapped to multiple zoom links
  * Pros: This creates more freedom and flexibility for users to add multiple zoom links for the same lesson.
  * Cons: Locating the specific zoom link to remove is tedious as we have to iterate through the list of zoom links that are mapped to the module lesson. 
          Additionally, we need to implement a mechanism to allow users to specify the exact zoom link to be deleted since using the module lesson
          is not sufficient.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it was significantly simpler to implement and did not violate any key design principles.
We also took into consideration the fact that it is unlikely for a single lesson to have multiple zoom links.


##### 3.1.4.3  Edit zoom link feature

This feature edits an existing zoom link in a module using the module lesson that is mapped to the
target zoom link.

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:

  * `EditZoomLinkParser`:
    * It implements `EditZoomLinkParser#parse()` to validate and parse the module index, module lesson and edited zoom link provided by the user.
      This creates a `ZoomDescriptor` object that encapsulates the zoom link details needed for the edit zoom link command.
    
  * `ZoomDescriptor`  
    * It stores and encapsulates the `ZoomLink` and `ModuleLesson` objects which will be used to execute the command to edit the zoom link 
    
  * `EditZoomLinkCommand`:  
    * It implements `EditZoomLinkCommand#execute()` which edits the target zoom link in the specified module encapsulated in `Model`
   

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for editing zoom links behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `editzoom 1 n/Lecture z/https://nus-sg.zoom.us/newLink` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ModuleListParser#parseCommand()` to create an `EditZoomLinkParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ModuleListParser` will call the `EditZoomLinkParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates an `EditZoomLinkCommand` using a `ZoomDescriptor` object that encapsulates the edited zoom link

Step 5. `EditZoomLinkCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to create
        the updated `Module` with the edited `ZoomLink` by calling the `Module#editZoomLink()` method

Step 5. The `Model#setModule()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to replace the target module with the updated module containing the edited zoom link

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`   

The sequence diagram of how the operation to edit a zoom link works is similar to the one in figure [3.3](#module-list-features), 
except that the respective parser and command classes are `EditZoomLinkParser` and `EditZoomLinkCommand`


##### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to implement the command to edit zoom link

* **Alternative 1:** Reuse the same `Parser` and `Command` classes used by the `AddZoomLink` command to implement the `EditZoomLink` command at the same time 
                     since the two commands have very similar implementations.

  * Pros: Reduces the amount of code that has to be written, as well as the number of classes that have to be implemented. 
  * Cons: Violates the **Single Responsibility Principle** since the same parser and command class have 2 separate responsibilities and have to perform 2 different operations.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement the `EditZoomLink` command separately.

  * Pros: Adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle and it is easier to implement the function since we do not need to handle 
          2 separate commands in the same parser and command classes.
  * Cons: Repetition of code may occur.
  
Alternative 2 was chosen since it was a good practice to follow key designing principles. Using alternative 1 would complicate
the implementation of the command since we had to handle 2 different commands within the same class and this can increase the difficulty of testing and debugging.


##### Aspect: Data structure to support zoom link commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a `HashMap` to store module lesson and zoom links in a module. Each module lesson
                                      will be used as a key which is mapped to a zoom link.
  * Pros: Checking for duplicate zoom links will be simpler.
  * Cons: Zoom links can only be uniquely identified by their module lesson. Any operation involving zoom link objects would
          require the module lesson that the zoom link is mapped to.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Encapsulate a zoom link object as a field of module lesson and use a `HashSet` to store module lesson objects.
  * Pros: It is easy to check for duplicate module lessons.
  * Cons: It is tedious to check for duplicate zoom links as we have to access the zoom link field of each module lesson in the hashset.
  
* **Alternative 3:** Encapsulate a zoom link object as a field of module lesson and use an `ArrayList` to store module lesson objects.
  * Pros: It is easy to identify module lessons by index. Users can provide the index of the module lesson for zoom link commands, 
          which is simpler compared to providing the module lesson name.  
  * Cons: The process of checking for duplicate module lessons and zoom links in the module is more tedious.

Alternative 1 was chosen since checking for duplicate zoom links occurs frequently during the execution of 
zoom link related commands. 




### 3.2 Contact list management feature

As a module tracking system, Cap 5 Buddy allows users to manage a list of module-related contacts with ease.
This is especially important since being enrolled in numerous modules can result in the need to keep track of
numerous contacts, each with different contact details.

The section below provides details of the implementation of each Contact List function and design considerations
of these features.

#### Contact list features

Below is a list of all `Contact` related features:

1. Add a contact: Adds a new contact into the contact list
2. Delete a contact: Deletes a pre-existing contact from the contact list
3. Edit a contact: Edits a pre-existing contact in the contact list
4. Find a contact: Search for contacts using different search parameters
5. Mark a contact as important: 
6. Sort the contact list:
7. List out all contacts in the contact list
8. Clear the contact list:


Given below is the class diagram of the `Contact` class:

![ContactClassDiagram](images/Contact/ContactClassDiagram.png)

Figure ?.? Class Diagram for Contact class

####  Details of implementation

##### 3.2.1  Add contact feature

This feature creates and adds a new `Contact` into the contact list if the contact does not already exist. 

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:

 * `AddContactParser`:
   * It implements `AddContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the user arguments to create a new `Contact`.

 * `AddContactCommand`:
   * It implements `AddContactCommand#execute()` which executes the addition of the new contact into `Model`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for adding contact behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `addcontact n/John e/john@gmail.com te/@johndoe` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ContactListParser#parseCommand()` to create an `AddContactParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ContactListParser` will call the `AddContactParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates an `AddContactCommand` and `AddContactCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to excecute the command to add the contact

Step 5. The `Model#addContact()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to add the new contact

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to add a contact works:
![AddContactSequenceDiagram](images/Contact/AddContactSequenceDiagram.png)
Figure ?.? Sequence diagram for the execution of `AddContactCommand`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddContactCommand` and `AddContactParser` should end

<br>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `AddContactCommand`:
![AddContactCommandActivityDiagram](images/Contact/AddContactCommandActivityDiagram.png)
Figure ?.? Activity diagram representing the execution of `AddContactCommand`

##### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Require users to provide all contact fields when adding a new contact

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Require `ContactName` and `Email` to be mandatory fields that must be provided, while leaving `Telegram` as an optional field
  * Pros: This caters to certain contacts who do not have a `Telegram` field, providing more flexibility for users when creating contacts.
  * Cons: This implementation of contact related methods can become complicated since we need to consider if the `Telegram` field of a contact 
          is present before any operation is performed. 

* **Alternative 2:** Require `ContactName`, `Email` and `Telegram` to be mandatory fields
  * Pros: The process of checking if 2 contacts are the same by comparing all 3 contact fields will be simpler.
  * Cons: This can create problems for users who want to add a contact that does not have a suitable `Telegram` field

Alternative 1 was chosen since it provides users with greater freedom when creating contacts. Enforcing all contact fields to be 
mandatory can restrict users when adding contacts, hindering user experience.


#### 3.2.2  Delete Contact Feature

The delete contact feature deletes a pre-existing `Contact` using the index of the contact on the displayed contact list.
This feature is facilitated by the following classes: 

  * `DeleteContactParser`:
    * It implements `DeleteContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the contact index 

  * `DeleteContactCommand`:
    * It implements `DeleteContactCommand#execute()` to delete the `Contact` from `Model`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for deleting contact behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `deletecontact 1` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ContactListParser#parseCommand()` to create a `DeleteContactParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ContactListParser` will call the `DeleteContactParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates a `DeleteContactCommand` and `DeleteContactCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to delete the target contact

Step 5. The `Model#deleteContact()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to delete the target contact from `Model`

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to delete a contact works:
![DeleteContactSequenceDiagram](images/Contact/DeleteContactCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
Fig 

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Mechanism to delete contacts

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete a contact based on its index in the displayed contact list
  * Pros: Using the contact index allows us to uniquely identify the target contact to delete, reducing the room for possible error
  * Cons: The target contact which the user wants to delete might not be displayed on the contact list and hence the contact index might not be
          readily available. This can inconvenience users who have to search for the contact to retrieve the contact index.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete a contact using the contact name
  * Pros: It can make the deletion process simpler for **users** who can provide the name of the contact without having to execute more commands.
  * Cons: This can complicate the deletion process since contacts with the same name is a possibility. If there are multiple
          contacts with the same provided name, more information of the target contact has to be provided by the user,
          creating more inconvenience for the user as well.

Alternative 1 was chosen since it guarantees a unique contact would be provided in every case. This ensures that the
target contact can be accurately identified and deleted, minimising the room for potential errors or bugs.  


#### 3.2.3  Edit Contact Feature

The edit contact feature edits a pre-existing contact in the contact list using contact details provided by the users.
This feature is facilitated by the following classes:

  * `EditContactParser`: 
    * It implements `EditContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the provided contact details and contact index

  * `EditContactDescriptor`:
    * It encapsulates the contact details which will be used to edit the target contact

  * `EditContactCommand`:
    * It implements `EditContactCommand#execute()` to edit the contact in `Model`
    
    
![EditContactDescriptorClassDiagram](images/Contact/EditContactDescriptorClassDiagram.png) 
Fig ?.? Class diagram describing the `EditContactDescriptor` class

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for editing contact behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `editcontact 1 n/John te/@johndoe` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ContactListParser#parseCommand()` to create an `EditContactParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ContactListParser` will call the `EditContactParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates an `EditContactCommand` and `EditContactCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to edit the target contact

Step 5. The `Model#setContact()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to replace the target contact with the edited contact

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to edit a contact works:

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to encapsulate the edited contact details and relay this information to EditContactCommand

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate all edited contact details in a class `EditContactDescriptor`
  * Pros: Reduces the complexity of the `EditContactCommand` class constructor as the number of parameters for the constructor
          is constant. It also reduces the level of coupling between `EditContactCommand` and `EditContactParser`
  * Cons: Additional method calls are require to store the edited contact details in `EditContactDescriptor` class.

* **Alternative 2:** Provide the edited contact details as arguments for the `EditContactCommand` constructor
  * Pros: Fewer method calls are required since `EditContactParser` can directly pass the edited contact arguments to the `EditContactCommand` constructor
  * Cons: This can increase data coupling between `EditContactParser` and `EditContactCommand` which can cause unnecessary changes in
          either class if the other class were to change.

Alternative 1 was chosen as it would make future changes to any class easier and less error-prone, 
hence increasing the ease of maintenance, since there was less coupling between the 2 classes.


##### Aspect: How to implement `EditContactCommand`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a separate `EditContactCommand` without reusing other command classes
  * Pros: Reduces coupling between the command classes and `EditContactCommand` can be implemented without restrictions,
          or a need to consider how it might affect the other command classes
  * Cons: Additional methods have to be implemented to replace the target contact with the edited contact

* **Alternative 2:** Reuse `DeleteContactCommand` to delete the target contact and `AddContactCommand` to add the edited contact
  * Pros: Reusing other commands would make the implementation of `EditContactCommand` simpler and more straightforward
  * Cons: It increases coupling between the 3 commands and this can cause issues to `EditContactCommand` if either 
          `DeleteContactCommand` or `AddContactCommand` developed bugs or errors. Also, it might affect performance since 
          executing `EditContactCommand` will execute 2 other commands.

Alternative 1 was chosen since it gave more freedom in regard to the implementation of `EditContactCommand` since
we were not restricted to reusing other commands. Less coupling between the classes meant that changes in one class would 
less likely require changes to other classes.


#### 3.2.4  Find Contact Feature

The find contact feature is important since sieving through all contacts to search for a specific contact can be 
tedious and not user-friendly. Finding contacts using one search parameter is not meaningful 
as the search results might not be refined and accurate.

The find contact feature searches for contacts using 2 parameters: contact name and/or tag. 
For each search parameter, contacts have to match at least one keyword to fulfil that search criteria.
If multiple parameters are provided, e.g both name and tag keywords, only contacts that fulfil both the name and tag criteria are returned. 

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:

  * `FindContactParser`:
    * It implements `FindContactParser#parse()` to parse and validate the user input
    * It creates predicate objects using the command arguments and adds them to the list of predicates in
      `FindContactCriteria`
    * It implements `FindContactParser#isAtLeastOnePrefixPresent()` to validate that at least one search parameter was provided by the user

  * `FindContactCriteria`:
    * It encapsulates all the predicates which will be used to test for matching contacts
    * It implements the following operations:
      * `FindContactCriteria#addPredicate()` to add a new predicate into the list of predicates 
         to test for matching contacts
      * `FindContactCriteria#getFindContactPredicate()` to compose all the predicates into a single predicate

    * Predicate objects that can be stored in `FindContactCriteria`:
      * `ContactNameContainsKeywordsPredicate`:
        * Tests if the name of a given contact matches at least one of the name keywords provided (case-insensitive)
      * `ContactContainsTagsPredicate`:
        * Tests if a given contact contains at least one of the search tags provided (case-insensitive)

  * `FindContactCommand`:
    * It implements `FindContactCommand#execute()` to find all matching contacts by updating the 
      filtered contact list in `Model` using the predicate from `FindContactCriteria`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for finding contact behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `findcontact n/John t/friend` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `ContactListParser#parseCommand()` to create a `FindContactParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `ContactListParser` will call the `FindContactParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates a `FindContactCriteria` that encapsulates the created `Predicate` objects to test for matching contacts

Step 4. Additionally, a `FindContactCommand` is created and `FindContactCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to find matching contacts

Step 5. The `Model#updateFilteredContactList()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to update the displayed contact list 
        using the predicate from `FindContactCriteria`

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

Given below is the sequence diagram of how the operation to find contact works:

Fig ?.? Sequence diagram describing the interaction between `FindContactParser` and `FindContactCriteria`


#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Storing of predicates in `FindContactCriteria`

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the predicates as a list of predicates
  * Pros: Composing the predicates into a single predicate is easier as we can simply iterate through the list
          and compose all the predicates.
  * Cons: Using a list means that the exact predicate objects in the list are not known. This can make testing and
          debugging more complicated. Moreover, we need to enforce checks on the predicate ensure that
          null objects, which can cause `NullPointerException` to be thrown, are not added.

* **Alternative 2:** Store each predicate object as an individual field of `FindContactCriteria`
  * Pros: Facilitates easier testing as we can accurately determine which predicate objects are present.
  * Cons: It is tedious to compose the predicates into a single predicate as we have to check each individual field and 
          determine if it is null of if the predicate exists. 

##### Aspect: How to implement `FindContactCommand` 

* **Alternative 1 :** Implement separate find contact commands for each possible search parameter. In this case, to find contacts, 
                      we can create a command to find contacts by name, and another to find by tags.
  * Pros: Implementation of the commands would be more straightforward, as only one predicate has to be created for each
          find contact command. The `FindContactCriteria` class to store all the predicates would not be necessary in this case.
  * Cons: This can increase the number of different find contact commands which can cause confusion for users.
          Additionally, this can lead to repetitive code since the implementation of each find contact command would be similar.      

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Implement a single `FindContactCommand` which can search for contacts using all the possible search parameters.
                                      All the predicates needed to test for matching contacts would be encapsulated in `FindContactCriteria` 
  * Pros: Reduces the need for multiple find contact commands with similar implementations. Users can make more refined and
          accurate searches by combining multiple search parameters.
  * Cons: Increases the complexity of implementing `FindContactParser` which has to validate and parse multiple search 
          parameters provided.




### 3.3 TodoList feature

#### Implementation

The TodoList feature has two main component :

* **Containee component** (Task-related classes)
  * `Class Task` - container class to store information about a task
  * `Class TaskName` - wrapper class to store the name of a task
  * `Class Date` - wrapper class to store the date/deadline of a task
  * `Enum Priority` - enum class to represent priority of a task
  * `Enum Status` - enum class to represent the progress status of a task

* **Container component** (List-like classes)
  * Class `UniqueTodoList` - container class for storing tasks
  * Class `TodoList` - wrapper class for UniqueTodoList
  * Interface `ReadOnlyTodoList` - interface for displaying the list on the GUI

##### Containee Component

The Task class mainly functions as a class to store all the informations related to a task i.e. name, tag, priority,
date, and status. It does not have any subclasses.

The Task class supports the following operations :

* Setters for all the field
* Getters for all the field
* `Task#isSameTask()` - checks if two tasks are the same i.e. have the same name
(weaker than Task#equals() which requires all the fields to be the same)
* `Task#hasSameTag()` - checks if the task has the specified tag
* `Task#hasSamePriority()` - checks if the task has the specified priority
* `Task#hasSameDate()` - checks if the task has the specified date

##### Container Component

The TodoList class is facilitated by UniqueTodoList. The UniqueTodoList is stored internally inside
the TodoList class which act like a wrapper class.

The TodoList class supports the following operations :

* `TodoList#resetData()` - replaces all data in TodoList with new data.
* `TodoList#hasTask()` - checks if the specified task exist in the list.
* `TodoList#addTask()` - adds a task to the list.
* `TodoList#setTask()` - replaces a task with the specified task.
* `TodoList#removeTask()` - removes the specified task from the list.

The operations above are exposed in the Model interface as :

* `Model#hasTask()`
* `Model#addTask()`
* `Model#setTask()`
* `Model#deleteTask()`

TodoList implements ReadOnlyTodoList which require the following operation :

* `ReadOnlyTodoList#getTodoList()` - returns an ObservableList with type Task that is immutable, and we cannot
  modify the elements.

#### Design Consideration

##### Aspect: Task type

* Alternative 1 (current): <br/>
  Use one concrete class i.e. Task without inheritance involved. The type of the task
  is represented by the Tag field instead.

  Pros :
  * Easier to implement
  * Types are not pre-defined i.e. can simply add a different tag to represent different type of task

  Cons :
  * All type of task have the same pre-defined field

* Alternative 2 : <br/>
  Use one abstract class i.e. Task with inheritance. Each subclasses represent a type of a Task.

  Pros :
  * Difference between type are clear and standardized
  * Can be considered more OOP

  Cons :
  * Types must be pre-defined i.e. cannot add new type of classes without adding codes

  Alternative 1 is chosen since we prioritize user freedom to create custom type for the task.

  


#### Find Task Feature

The find task feature is crucial as it enables users to retrieve tasks efficiently rather than having to scan through their
entire todo list to find the desired task. This can also contribute to a better management of user tasks which is important since Cap 5 Buddy
is an application to track module related details and information. To ensure that searching for tasks is refined and accurate, this feature enables users to search using multiple parameters.

The search parameters that can be used to find tasks include: `Name`, `Date`, `Tag`, `Priority` and `Status`. If multiple search
parameters are provided by users, only tasks that fulfil all the search criteria will be returned.

This feature is facilitated by the following classes:

  * `FindTaskParser`:
    * It implements `FindTaskParser#parse()` to parse and validate the user input
    * It creates predicate objects using the command arguments and adds them to the list of predicates in
      `FindTaskCriteria`
    * It implements `FindTaskParser#isAtLeastOnePrefixPresent()` to validate that at least one search parameter was provided by the user
    
  * `FindTaskCriteria`:
    * It encapsulates all the predicates which will be used to test for matching tasks
    * It implements the following operations:
      * `FindTaskCriteria#addPredicate()` to add a new predicate into the list of predicates 
        to test for matching tasks
      * `FindTaskCriteria#getFindTaskPredicate()` to compose all the predicates into a single predicate
        
  * Predicate objects that can be stored in `FindTaskCriteria`:
    * `TaskNameContainsKeywordsPredicate`:
      * Tests if the name of a given task matches at least one of the name keywords provided (case-insensitive)
    * `TaskContainsTagsPredicate`:
      * Tests if a given task contains at least one of the search tags provided (case-insensitive)
    * `TaskMatchesDatePredicate`:
      * Tests if the date of a given task matches the search date exactly.
    * `TaskMatchesPriorityPredicate`:
      * Tests if the priority of a given task matches the search priority exactly (case-insensitive)
    * `TaskMatchesStatusPredicate`:
      * Tests if the status of a given task matches the search status exactly (case-insensitive)
  
Given below is the class diagram describing the `FindTaskCriteria` class:
![FindTaskCriteriaClassDiagram](images/FindTaskCriteriaClassDiagram.png)

   * `FindTaskCommand`:
     * It implements `FindTaskCommand#execute()` to find all matching tasks by updating the 
       filtered todo list in `Model` using the predicate from `FindTaskCriteria`
       
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism for finding tasks behaves at each step:

Step 1. `LogicManager` receives the user input `findtask n/lab d/2020-01-01` from `Ui`

Step 2. `LogicManager` calls `TodoListParser#parseCommand()` to create a `FindTaskParser`

Step 3. Additionally, `TodoListParser` will call the `FindTaskParser#parse()` method to parse the command arguments

Step 4. This creates a `FindTaskCriteria` that encapsulates the created `Predicate` objects to test for matching tasks

Step 4. Additionally, a `FindTaskCommand` is created and `FindTaskCommand#execute()` will be invoked by `LogicManager` to find matching tasks

Step 5. The `Model#updateFilteredTodoList()` operation exposed in the `Model` interface is invoked to update the displayed todo list 
        using the predicate from `FindTaskCriteria`

Step 6. A `CommandResult` from the command execution is returned to `LogicManager`

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes `FindTaskCommand`
![FindTaskCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How to handle instances when the user does not provide any search parameter

* **Alternative 1 :** Allow users to provide 0 search parameters, in which case the find task command does not perform any operation.
  
  * Pros: Implementation of the command is simpler and straightforward as we do not need to check if at least one search parameter was provided.
  * Cons: The command does not perform any meaningful operation.
  
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Handle instances when no search parameter was provided using exceptions and inform users that at least one parameter is required.

  * Pros: Ensures that users are aware of all the constraints related to the command.
  * Cons: The implementation of the command is more complex since exception handling is required and 
          we need to check if at least one search parameter was provided.

Alternative 2 was chosen as it conformed with the standard practice of handling errors using exception. Moreover, it removes any room for 
ambiguity by ensuring all constraints related to the command are made known to the users.




    
### 3.4 Event list management feature



### \[Proposed\] Add Event feature
![Structure of the Add Event command](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram.png)
#### Proposed Implementation
The idea of this feature is to be able to allow the user to keep track of his/her current events that
will be happening. Events can be either a one time event like an exam for a particular module, or a recurring
event like a weekly tutorial class.

How we are currently implementing this feature is by following the same implementation as the AB3. We have an event
object under the Model package. Two classes called EventName and EventTime act as information containers to store
the respective data and help support the Event class.

We also make sure in the Logic package, there are personal sub-parsers for each of the existing Event
related commands, and an overall Parser known as SchedulerParser that is in charge of managing all of the
sub-parsers of the Scheduler. 

Each of the commands of the Scheduler will always return a CommandResult class, that is basically an information
container that stores all the relevant data of the results. This CommandResult object is then passes back up to the
UiManager, where it is then passed to the GUI components for it to be displayed.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: Whether to create a new Parser for Scheduler.
Option 1 **(Current implementation)**: A custom Parser in charge of all **Scheduler** related commands **only**.
Pros: 
- More OOP orientated.
- More defensive programming.
Cons:
- More Parsers to handle by the ParserManager

Option 2: Place the Scheduler related parser together with the rest of the other parsers for other features, like module list, etc.
Pros:
- Faster to implement.
- Less effort needed, simply add on to the existing Parser.
Cons:
- Mess and less readible, hard to distinguish between differnt commands.
- Higher chance of errors, as we are mixing all the different parsers for every feature into a single Parser.
- LONG methods.
